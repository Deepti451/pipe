    <subject>Exciting new app for your Treatment Center</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

We&apos;re proud to be rolling out a treatment center app which is compatible with Salesforce. We are getting close to having the demo product ready and would love the chance to show it off. I&apos;m reaching out to see if you have any interest in the roll out so I can set up time to demo the product to you. It will feature...

Availability projections- you will know exactly how many beds available and on what date
Sober living collections tools- Know who is paid on rent and what the balance may be.
Client fund tools- No more fumbling receipts and carrying around clients credit cards or cash.
Alumni surveys- Call logs generated from app using predictive model based on risk factors from survey.

We are also a Full Service Salesforce Partner. Let me know I could send an eBook explaining our services for treatment centers.

Regards,
